/cgem5/src/dev/arm/SystemC_Accelerator/devX:
i)    Add file AccelDevice(.cc | .hh): This is the cpp GEM5 device (It contains both C++ AccelDevice and SystemC ConnectToSystemC)
ii)   Add file SystemCDevice(.cc | .hh): The SystemC Device implementation (*****)
iii)  Add RealView.py: The device configuration (class AccelDevice)

kernel_build/linux-arm-gem5/kernel && kernel_build/linux-arm64-gem5/kernel
i)  SystemC_driver (.c |.h): This is the device Kernel Driver
ii) AccelDriver (.c |.h): This is the device UserSpace Driver

kernel_build/Application
i)   TestApp.c: This is the application (*****)
ii)  AccelDriver.a: The Accelerator Library
iii) AccelDriver.h: The Header Library file
iv)  Makefile (to build the application using the library)

/kernel_build
build32.sh: This is the script which compliles the kernel and add the AccelDriver(.c |.h) & TestApp.c inside the 32bit .img
build64.sh: This is the script which compliles the kernel and add the AccelDriver(.c |.h) & TestApp.c inside the 64bit .img

/cgem5
run32.sh: This is the script which run the Device with 500MHz for 32bit ARM
run64.sh: This is the script which run the Device with 500MHz for 64bit ARM


vmlinux.aarch32.Accel: This is the 32 bit kernel which contains the Accelerator driver
vmlinux.aarch64.Accel: This is the 64 bit kernel which contains the Accelerator driver

PS: Files with (*****) must be modified to suport the implement your Accelerator
